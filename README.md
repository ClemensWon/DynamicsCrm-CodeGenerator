### Version: 10.5.1
---

A Visual Studio extension for generating early bound classes for Microsoft Dynamics CRM entities based on a template file, similar to Entity Framework.

## Features

  + Built for Visual Studio
    + You never have to leave Visual Studio to regenerate the code
	+ All the configurations are saved in the project itself, which facilitates Version Control
  + Preserved the original CrmSvcUtil structure and logic
  + Customize the way the code is generated
    + You get a default T4 template for the code that is generated, with a multitude more features than the official tool (features below)
	+ You can rewrite the whole template if you wish for any possible requirements
  + Replaced the SDK types with .NET types
    + E.g. OptionSetValue => Enum (Enum[] for Multi-select), EntityReference => Guid, Money => decimal, ... etc.
  + Generate only what's needed
    + Only choose the entities required
    + Only the fields required
  + Additional control
    + Option to use display names of entities and fields as variable names instead of logical names
    + Override field names inside the tool's UI
    + Ability to Lock variable names to avoid code errors on regeneration
  + Greatly enhanced regeneration speed by only fetching changed metadata from the server
  + Support for strongly-typed alternate keys, for entities and Entity References
  + Add annotations for model validation
  + Generate metadata
    + Field logical and schema names
    + Localised labels
  + Automatically limit attributes retrieved from CRM on any entity in a LINQ to the ones choosen (filtered) in the tool (check new entity constructors)
  + Many options to optimise generated code size even further
  + Define web service contracts with different profiles
    + Option to mark certain fields as 'read-only'
    + Option to link CRM entity profile with contract profiles, which effectively copies selection changes made in contracts to the CRM entity
  + Generate concrete classes for CRM Actions
  + Support bulk relation loading
    + Support filtering on relation loading

This tool is available as an XrmToolBox plugin as well ([here](https://www.xrmtoolbox.com/plugins/plugininfo/?id=45abdb43-f0e5-ea11-bf21-281878877ebf)).

## How To Use

You can read a quick overview of the tool and its functionality [here](http://blog.yagasoft.com/2020/09/dynamics-template-based-code-generator-supercharged).

To get started, install the Visual Studio extension ([here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Yagasoft.CrmCodeGenerator)).

Note: any window can be closed by pressing the _ESC_ button on the keyboard, even if the generator is busy.

#### Add a template to your project

Highlight the project where you want to add the template and generated code.   
Click on Tools â€“> Add CRM Code Generator Template... (if you don't see this menu, then shutdown VS and reinstall the extension).

![File](http://blog.yagasoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/crm-generator-external-06.png)

  + Start with one of the provided templates.
  + After a template is added to your project you will be prompted for CRM connection info.
  + Pick the entities that you want to include.
  + Click the "Generate Code" button.

If you make schema changes in CRM and you want to refresh the code, right click the template and select "Run Custom Tool".

#### Changing the template

When you make changes to the template and save, Visual Studio will automatically attempt to regenerate the code.

## Credits

  + Base code:
	+ Eric Labashosky
	+ https://github.com/xairrick/CrmCodeGenerator
  + My work:
	+ Completely reworked the screens
	+ Greatly enhanced the generation and regeneration speed
	+ Added the features that don't exist in the official tool

## Upcoming/planned

+ Add: option to add alternate keys to contracts
+ Add: option to use CRM-only contracts to replace Contract classes, optionally
+ Add: [template] File field, with a Get and Set that uses the SDK message
+ Add: [template] an attribute/annotation to the Clear Flag fields in contracts, to ease parsing them in helper methods
+ Add: [template] XrmDefinitelyTyped support, and generate form structure
+ Add: enum annotations (DisplayName ... etc.)
+ Add: parse placeholders in annotations for LogicalName and variable name
+ Improve: switch to async extension VS API
  + The 'sync extension' warning in VS is definitely annoying, but I have to make sure that a single version will be backward compatible back to at least VS 2015
+ Improve: [template] rework lookup labels localisation
  + After the upgrade to v7, it has been buggy, and I don't like how it uses ExecuteMultiple to load labels in the first place; so I need to come up with a method that is faster but still as efficient
+ Improve: [template] unify global option-sets into a single enum
+ Update: [template] XrmToolBox template to match this extension's
+ Fix: catch and fix the extremely rare 'null reference' error that requires clearing the cache for the tool to work again
+ Fix: [template] helpers to support new stuff since v7
  + LoadRelation methods

## Changes

#### _v10.5.1 (2020-09-21)_
+ Added: option to link CRM entity profile with contract profiles, effectively copying selection changes made in contracts to the CRM entity to keep them in sync
+ Fixed: connection string values containing '=' character causing connectivity issue (e.g. client secrets containing '=')
#### _v10.4.2 (2020-09-15)_
+ Added: option to define entity, attribute, and contract custom annotations through the UI
+ Added: [template] helper to automatically limit attributes retrieved from CRM on any entity in a LINQ to the ones choosen (filtered) in the tool (check new entity constructors)
+ Added: [template] helper to automatically parse Aliased Values into their respective early-bound properties in entity records retrieved by a FetchXML query
+ Improved: tool startup speed
+ Improved: mapper error-handling
